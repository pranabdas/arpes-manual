Our ARPES chambers are usually baked at 120 \u00b0C for 72 hours after various maintenance and upgrade works. In order to bake the chambers follow the steps: Switch off the manipulator motor driver electrics. Disconnect the motor cables. Remove the motors. Leave the screws on the manipulator. Remove all the junction boxes and cables. Remove camera and cables. Remove the slit wheel knob. Note down the reading or make sure nobody changes the knob wheel while detached. Remove high voltage isolators for the Mott detector. Remove all other components that cannot be baked e.g., LED lights, cameras, cooling water pipes.

Thermal broadening is given by Fermi Dirac distribution: F(\\epsilon) = \\frac{1}{e^{(\\epsilon - \\mu)/k_B T} + 1} F(\\epsilon) = \\frac{1}{e^{(\\epsilon - \\mu)/k_B T} + 1} Above measurement was carried out at liquid nitrogen temperature; the sample temperature reaches about 90 K, at which the Fermi-Dirac distribution looks like this: Now, we can convolute a Gaussian broadening of 10 meV, which fits our experimental data well. There is some room for adjusting the fitting parameters, but the slope is certainly better than 15 meV for our current data. Therefore, we have about 8 meV thermal broadening at 90 K and 10 meV instrumental (combines analyzer resolution, light source broadening etc.), i.e., we can expect better than 15 meV (\\sigma_{total} \\le \\sqrt{\\sigma_x^2 + \\sigma_y^2}) (\\sigma_{total} \\le \\sqrt{\\sigma_x^2 + \\sigma_y^2}) resolution.","title":"Experimental ARPES resolution"},{"location":"sample-mounting/","text":"Sample mounting We use standard Omicron sample holder.
