Open the valve before the needle valve. Open the needle valve slowly, and monitor the pressure. The FG1 in the VUV PCU should reach \\sim 1 \\times 10^{-1} \\sim 1 \\times 10^{-1} mbar. Roughly two full rotation in the needle valve, there is a blue mark. Turn on the electronics of the helium lamp. Wait for few minutes. If there is any red light/sign on the interlock, press the reset switch. It should clear all warnings/red lights. Switch ON, and immediately OFF the HV ON/OFF switch to turn on the filament only. Wait for 1 minute. Then switch ON the HV ON/OFF switch, and look in the viewport if there is pitch color light (a color between orange and yellow). If not switch off the high voltage, and adjust the Helium pressure. Check the reflection from wave guide. It should be close to zero. Otherwise, adjust the helium pressure. Turning off the lamp Switch off the High Voltage. Press the reset button to switch off the filament, if not needed. Close the helium needle valve. Close the valve before needle valve.

Here we will describe a practical scenario. The sample for this measurement was grown using molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) method. The sample was of very good quality. We obtained the following ARPES spectrum using 10~eV 10~eV pass energy and 5~meV 5~meV energy step. We extract the Energy Distribution Curve (EDC) by integrating \\pm0.25~\u00c5^{-1} \\pm0.25~\u00c5^{-1} range. Thermal broadening is given by Fermi Dirac distribution: F(\\epsilon) = \\frac{1}{e^{(\\epsilon - \\mu)/k_B T} + 1} F(\\epsilon) = \\frac{1}{e^{(\\epsilon - \\mu)/k_B T} + 1} Above measurement was carried out at liquid nitrogen temperature; the sample temperature reaches about 90~K 90~K , at which the Fermi-Dirac distribution looks like this: Now, we can convolute a Gaussian broadening of 10~meV 10~meV , which fits our experimental data well. There is some room for adjusting the fitting parameters, but the slope is certainly better than 15~meV 15~meV for our current data. Therefore, we have about 8~meV 8~meV thermal broadening at 90~K 90~K and 10~meV 10~meV instrumental (combines analyzer resolution, light source broadening etc.), i.e., we can expect better than 15~meV 15~meV (\\sigma_{total} \\le \\sqrt{\\sigma_x^2 + \\sigma_y^2}) (\\sigma_{total} \\le \\sqrt{\\sigma_x^2 + \\sigma_y^2}) resolution.","title":"ARPES Resolution"},{"location":"resolution/#experimental-arpes-resolution","text":"The ARPES experimental resolution depends on several factors including measurement temperature, sample quality, quality of electrical contact between sample and analyzer, light source used, and the analyzer resolution.
