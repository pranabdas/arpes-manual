### Data analysis 

All ARPES and XPS data are recorded by Scienta-Omicron SES software. We store bandstructure data in both Igor and plain text formats, while the Fermi mapping data is stored in a zipped binary format. The data can be easily opened by Igor program, or our [arpespythontools](https://pranabdas.github.io/docs/arpespythontools/) package can be used analyze the data. A MATLAB loader is also available from us. One can implement data loaders for other plotting programs.
