All ARPES and XPS data are recorded by Scienta-Omicron SES software. We store
bandstructure data in both Igor and plain text formats, while the Fermi mapping
data is stored in a zipped binary format. The data can be easily opened by Igor
program, or our [arpespythontools](
https://pranabdas.github.io/arpespythontools) package can be used analyze the
data. A MATLAB loader is also available from us. One can implement data loaders
for other plotting programs.

Also, if you only need to obtain integrated intensity from the SES spectra for
XPS data analysis, you may try our [web application](
https://pranabdas.github.io/xps/).
