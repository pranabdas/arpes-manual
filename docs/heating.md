### Heating stage operation

Make sure water cooling is ON. Close the gate valve between preparation and
analysis chambers. Increase the temperature slowly while monitoring the chamber
pressure (should not be worse than $1 \times 10^{-7}$ mbar at any stage, if
possible try to maintain better pressure).

Our heating system allows both resistive heating and e-beam heating. Note that
the temperature sensor is away from the sample position. As a result, the read
out temperature is lower than the actual sample temperature. Please refer to

for more details.
