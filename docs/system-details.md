### About ARPES system

- The ARPES system comprised of Scienta-Omicron DA30L hemispherical electron
analyzer.
- Base pressure of the system is ~1&nbsp;✕&nbsp;10<sup>-10</sup> mbar.
- A Scienta VUV-5k helium discharge lamp with monochromator is used as photon
source.
- Mott spin detectors are also available for spin-resolved band measurement.
- The manipulator can be cooled down using either liquid nitrogen (sample
temperature ~90&nbsp;K) or liquid helium cryogen.
- Single crystalline sample can be exfoliated or cleaved in the load-lock
chamber (pressure ~5&nbsp;✕&nbsp;10<sup>-8</sup> mbar).
- Thin film samples can be grown in-situ using PLD.
- Certain samples can be prepared by argon sputtering and annealing.
