### Analyzer Operation
Make sure correct analyzer slit is chosen.

**Element Voltages:** <br/>
MCP = 1550 V <br/>
SCREEN = 3600 V.

If the count is too high, please reduce the MCP voltage to 1500 V or even 1400 V
(especially when performing spin measurements with Mott detectors, and the slit
is set to very wide). Count should not exceed few million, it can damage the
detector mesh permanently. If you do not need MCP spectrum, please set the MCP
voltage to 1200 V or below.
