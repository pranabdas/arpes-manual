title: Sample mounting
---

We use standard Omicron sample holder. If the sample does not require heating,
we can fix samples using silver epoxy. In case of XPS measurement, we can fix
the sample using carbon- or copper-tapes. The sample dimension has to be less
than 10&nbsp;mm ✕ 10&nbsp;mm. If the sample require heating, we need to fix the
sample using metal stripes, and screw the stripes. It is better to have
following sample dimensions:

1. 5&nbsp;mm ✕ 10&nbsp;mm
2. 10&nbsp;mm ✕ 10&nbsp;mm
3. Basically, one side 10&nbsp;mm and other side anywhere between [5, 10]&nbsp;mm
4. 5&nbsp;mm ✕ 5&nbsp;mm
5. Arbitrary sample sizes maybe accommodated, please check with us.

Note that above sample sizes are applicable only for the samples that requires
heating, or has to go inside the PLD chamber. If the sample does not require
heating, any size that fits inside 10&nbsp;mm ✕ 10&nbsp;mm area is OK.
