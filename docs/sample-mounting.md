### Sample mounting 

We use standard Omicron sample holder. If the sample does not require heating, we can fix samples using silver epoxy. In case of XPS measurement, we can fix the sample using carbon- or copper-tapes. The sample dimension has to be less than 10 mm $\times$ 10 mm. If the sample require heating, we need to fix the sample using metal stripes, and screw the stripes. It is better to have following sample dimensions: 

1. 5 mm $\times$ 10 mm 
2. 10 mm $\times$ 10 mm 
3. Basically, one side 10 mm and other side anywhere between 5 - 10 mm 
4. 5 mm $\times$ 5 mm 
5. Arbitrary sample sizes maybe accommodated, please check with us. 

Note that above sample sizes are applicable only for the samples that requires heating, or has to go inside the PLD chamber. If the sample does not require heating, any size that fits inside 10 mm $\times$ 10 mm area is OK.
