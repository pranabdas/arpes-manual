### Sample dimension

We use standard Omicron sample holder. If the sample does not require heating,
we can fix samples using silver epoxy. In case of XPS measurement, we can fix
the sample using carbon- or copper-tapes. The sample dimension has to be less
than 10&nbsp;mm ✕ 10&nbsp;mm. If the sample require heating, we need to fix the
sample using metal stripes, and screw the stripes. It is better to have
following sample dimensions:

- 5&nbsp;mm ✕ 10&nbsp;mm
- 10&nbsp;mm ✕ 10&nbsp;mm
- Basically, one side 10&nbsp;mm and other side anywhere between [5, 10]&nbsp;mm
- 5&nbsp;mm ✕ 5&nbsp;mm
- Arbitrary sample sizes maybe accommodated, please check with us.

Note that above sample sizes are applicable only for the samples that requires
heating, or has to go inside the PLD chamber. If the sample does not require
heating, any size that fits inside 10&nbsp;mm ✕ 10&nbsp;mm area is OK.

### Ex-situ sample transfer

If your thin-film is grown in another laboratory (by Molecular Beam Epitaxy or
Pulsed Laser Deposition method) and you want to transfer to our ARPES chamber
for measurement, we have following options:

1. Deposit a suitable capping layer (e.g., amorphous selenium) on top of your
sample surface. We can transfer such capped sample in atmosphere, and
subsequently anneal at suitable temperature in our PLD chamber or on the heating
stage mounted at ARPES preparation chamber.

2. It is also possible to use a vacuum suitcase (if your growth laboratory is
located within Singapore) and connect to our load-lock chamber.

### Sample cleaving mechanism

We usually cleave single crystalline samples or exfoliate layered materials in
the load-lock chamber, where we can expect a vacuum better than 5&nbsp;✕10<sup>
-7</sup> mbar. Bulk single crystalline samples can be cleaved by top-post method
by attaching a pin applying strong glue (two component silver epoxy or torr
seal) and later knocking out the pin by using a wobble-stick, while the layered
materials can be exfoliated by attaching Kapton tape.

Sample surface can also be prepared by [sputtering](sputtering.md) and
[annealing](heating.md) method.

### Epoxy for sample fixing

Samples are usually fixed using two component silver epoxy (Epotek H20E), both
components should be mixed at 1&nbsp;:&nbsp;1 weight ratio. Hardening condition
for Epotek H20E:

- 80 deg C for 3 hrs.
- 100 deg C for 2 hrs.
- 120 deg C for 15 mins.
- 150 deg C for 5 mins.
- 175 deg C for 45 sec.

We also use Torr-seal to mount sample or fix top-post pin, where we need
stronger glue. Remember torr-seal is insulating, and requires graphite coating.
