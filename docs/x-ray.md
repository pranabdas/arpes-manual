title: X-ray Source Operation

Make sure water cooling is ON. There are two separate water cooling lines (each
having one inlet and one outlet pipes): one for the anode where the direction of
water flow is important, and another for the outer jacket. Set the x-ray gun
closer to the sample (linear drive position = 4 cm). Once the measurement is
done, retract the gun to linear drive position = 2 cm.

X-rays energies: <br/>
Al Kɑ = 1486.6 eV <br/>
Mg Kɑ = 1253.6 eV.

Chose the desired anode. For both of them, set: <br/>
Anode voltage = 12 kV <br/>
Anode current = 10 mA.
