title: Sputter gun operation
---

Sputtering is an effective technique to remove the oxidation layer and other
contaminations from the sample surface. This method also requires
[annealing](heating.md) of the sample after sputtering to recrystallize the
surface. Generally to obtain good ARPES quality surface, we need several cycles
of sputtering and annealing.

Sputter gun position is 100° (with respect to measurement position = 0° and
transfer position = 90°). Set suitable Argon pressure (~10<sup>-6</sup> mbar).

Energy = 1 kV <br/>
Emission = 5 mA.

We have no way to monitor sample current, so follow the trail and error method.
