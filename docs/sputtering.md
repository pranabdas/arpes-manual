### Sputter gun operation

Sputter gun position is 100° (with respect to measurement position = 0° and
transfer position = 90°). Set suitable argon pressure (~&nbsp;$10^{-6}$ mbar).

Energy = 1 kV <br/>
Emission = 5 mA.

We have no way to monitor sample current, so follow the trail and error method.
