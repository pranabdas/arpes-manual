title: Sputter gun operation
---

Sputtering is an effective technique to remove the oxidation layer and other
contaminations from the sample surface. This method requires subsequent
[annealing](heating.md) of the sample to recrystallize the surface. Generally to
obtain good ARPES quality surface, we need several cycles of sputtering and
annealing.

Sputter gun position is 100° (with respect to measurement position = 0° and
transfer position = 90°). Set suitable Argon pressure (~10<sup>-6</sup> mbar)
for sputtering.

Energy = 1 kV <br/>
Emission = 5 mA.

Unfortunately, at the moment we do not have a way to monitor the sample current.
